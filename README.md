## About Stay Woke
Stay Woke is an android application that alerts drivers when they are falling asleep. By using the [Muse](https://choosemuse.com/) Meditation Headset, we are effectively able to analyze EEG data to make predictions about drowsiness. 

## The Problem

Drowsy driving accounts for a large proportion of accidents on the road. In fact 1 in 25 drivers over the age of 18 report falling asleep at the wheel in the previous 30 days. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that drowsy driving was responsible for 72,000 crashes, 44,000 injuries, and 800 deaths in 2013. A study by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety estimated the actual number to be 328,000, over three times what is reported. Drowsy driving was involved in 6\% of all crashes in which a vehicle was towed from the scene, 7\% of crashes in which a person received treatment for injuries sustained in the crash and 13\% of crashes in which a person was hospitalized. Some studies have demonstrated drowsy driving to be even more dangerous than tipsy driving. Fatigue-related crashes cost society about \$109 billion annually (property damage, health insurance, etc.) One of the biggest demographics affected by this is long haul truck drivers. Many truck drivers report having to drive while sleepy in order to make it to their destination.
